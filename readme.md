# Pragmatic Genetic Programming with Nudge

## Caveat

This particular project is undergoing a lot of serious surgery right now.

## What it does

Well, it's complicated, and in a state of dynamic change right this second.

Let's just say it helps _regular people_ build, run and manage technical experiments that use genetic programming. There's more... but that's the bottom line.

## Getting started

You'll need a working (and running) installation of CouchDB.

Then:

    gem install nudge
    gem install thor
    gem install couch-rest
    gem install sinatra
    
and for running specs (which you _should be doing_):
    
    gem install rspec
    gem install sinatra
    gem install fakeweb
